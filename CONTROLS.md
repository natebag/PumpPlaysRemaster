## How Voting Works

1. Type a command in chat during the vote window (3 seconds)
2. Most-voted command wins and gets executed
3. Ties are broken randomly
4. You earn PPP points for every winning vote
5. Top players get hourly PPP token rewards

## Team Rocket (Burn to Play)

Burn PPP tokens to bypass voting and inject commands directly:

| Tier | Burn Amount | Direct Commands/Hour |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| Grunt | 10,000 PPP | 1 |
| Executive | 50,000 PPP | 3 |
| Boss | 250,000 PPP | 10 |
